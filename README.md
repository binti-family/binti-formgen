# Binti Formgen

This will generate a bunch of files that you will need when adding a new set of Create/Edit forms in the Binti Family application. You can copy-paste the file contents manually or download the zip file and unzip it (using the `unzip binti-formgen.zip` terminal command) from the root directory of Family and that should place the files where they need to go! From there, you will need to add some lines to our query_types.rb and mutation_types.rb files and you should be good!!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
